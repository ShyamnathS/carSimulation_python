# Self-Driving Car Simulation

This project simulates a self-driving car that moves along a track, detecting the surroundings using pixel values to navigate. The car follows a path and changes direction based on obstacles, utilizing the Pygame library for graphics and handling the game loop.

## Features

- **Car Navigation**: The car moves along the track, detecting obstacles using pixel values.
- **Automatic Direction Change**: The car changes direction when it encounters an obstacle, rotating 90 degrees as necessary.
- **Real-time Graphics**: The simulation displays a track and car in motion, with the car adjusting its movement based on detected obstacles.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pygame library: Used for rendering the game window and managing game events.

You can install the required library using:

```bash
pip install pygame
